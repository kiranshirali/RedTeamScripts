# RedTeamScripts

This is a repositary wherein I am holding all successful/useful commands or scripts that I use in my day to day activities of breaking into stuff. 

I shall take no credit in the stuff that I have not written myself and thank all those faceless scripting gurus out there that make my life so much easier and in that effect I have tried to provide a citation to places wherein my scripts have been inspired from.
